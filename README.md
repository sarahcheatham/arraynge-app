# [ arraynge ]

Arraynge is an application made specifically for Kindergarten through 8th grade teachers who use the NWEA MAP test to assess their students. 

I built this applications to simplify how teachers, such as myself create leveled groups based on studentâ€™s test scores throughout the year without the need to physically write out their list using pen and paper.


### Build Tools
A full stack web application built using React.js and Redux for the front-end, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose.js and a MongoDB database for the back-end,  and jwt/bcrypt for authentication.
