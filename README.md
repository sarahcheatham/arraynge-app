# [ arraynge ]

Arraynge is an application made specifically for Kindergarten through 8th grade teachers who use the NWEA MAP test to assess their students. 

My application allows teachers to sort students based on their test scores and then group the students based on their skill level. 

### Build Tools
A full stack web application built using React for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database.

### Instructions
1. Create an account.
2. Click the button that says, "CREATE A NEW ARRAYNGEMENT".
3. Choose your grade level and subject.
4. Enter how many students you have in your class and this will generate enough forms for each of your students. 
5. Enter each student's test score and press save, when finished entering all the scores press continue located at the bottom of the page. 
6. Now you are able to sort students high to low based on their beginning of the year, middle of the year, end of the year goal, and end of the year test scores. You can also drag and drop students into groups. 



<!-- ### Back Story
 I am currently working as a Kindergarten teacher, in Austin, Texas, and have been for the past 4 years. I teach my students in a small group, rotation style environment, which just means I divide up my class into 3 or 4 groups based on their skill level and then rotate through groups until I have met with each group. I do this for both reading and math, which allows me to meet with each student every day and to target my instruction based on skill level. 

 My problem, that I solved with this app, was that the only way, or the fastest way, I could make my leveled groups was to first, physically hand write out a list of all my students and their test scores. Then I had to write out another list of all my students and their test scores from high to low. Then finally write out another list where I actually form my groups.

This was some thing I would have to do three times per year for both math and reading and it would usually take about an hour to analyze and group students based on this data.  -->
